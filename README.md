# FLIR-camera-based-monitoring-of-Extrusion
This a code for the monitoring of the process of extrusion. This code has been specifically designed for usage in 3D bioprinters which extrude bioinks containing living cells. This system has the capability to not just detect flaws during the process of extrusion, it also has the ability to quantify the flawlessly extruded material. It analysis the extruded material geometrically and gives a feedback about the size of the extruded material.
## This code has been made private since it was developed with Next Big Innovation Labs.
